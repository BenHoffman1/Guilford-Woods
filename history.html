                        <h2>The Woods</h2>
                        <p>Earlier known as the New Garden Woods, the approximately 200 acres are part of Guilford
                            College's campus and felt as a sacred place. Located within the historically Quaker New
                            Garden/Guilford College community, these woods remain a relatively stable landscape with old
                            growth forest and at least one champion tree standing as a silent witness.</p>
                        <p>Abolitionist Levi Coffin grew up north of the site and references these woods between his
                            home and his New Garden Quaker Meeting as a place of refuge. The case of John Dimery's
                            escape and quick movement to Indiana in 1819 is the earliest documented instance of
                            Underground Railroad activity. Levi and Vestal Coffin were known leaders assisting runaways
                            going to Indiana from 1819 to 1826. The legacy of justice continued with documented
                            anti-slavery activists serving on the initial staff of New Garden Boarding School when it
                            opened in 1837. A runaway notice in the January 4, 1842 Greensborough Patriot specifically
                            references the New Garden community. Even if the school was not institutionally involved,
                            the land served as a crossroad to freedom -- the Southern Terminus for those slipping away
                            north to Indiana.</p>
                        <p>The historical significance of the woods as a place of refuge has been passed down through
                            the years so they have been intentionally protected for the past twenty-five years. They are
                            located near -- but not on -- several main local roadways of the early nineteenth century
                            (see Maps section for details) and, not inconsequentially, directly between New Garden
                            Friends Meeting and the Coffin family farm along a southern branch of Horse Pen Creek.
                            Portions of these woods remained unploughed and wooded throughout the eighteenth and
                            nineteenth century, so there was plenty of cover created by trees and the terrain in less
                            developed areas.</p>

                        <h2>History of the New Garden Community</h2>
                        <p>The New Garden community was settled by European American Quakers in the mid-1700s and was a
                            vibrant farming community located west of the Guilford County seat of Greensboro (founded
                            1808). By 1830, Guilford County was 84% white with 14% enslaved black and 2% free black
                            populations. The New Garden community was predominantly white with some free black residents
                            and nearby properties with enslaved residents (most well documented in relation to
                            anti-slavery efforts is the David Caldwell property to the east of New Garden). Unlike the
                            eastern part of the state, there was a significant presence of non-slaveholding white
                            abolitionist Quakers and Wesleyan Methodists living amongst the influential slaveholding
                            families.</p>
                        <p>New Garden was located near crossroads used by those forcibly moving enslaved people from
                            Virginia and North Carolina to developing agricultural areas further south and west. The New
                            Garden community was also tied to northern free state areas through family and faith
                            community connections to Quaker settlements in the northwest, most especially to Wayne
                            County, Indiana, and other areas of Indiana and Ohio where both Quaker and African Americans
                            from North Carolina began to settle in the early 1800s.</p>

                        <p>The participation of, and leadership contributed by, North Carolina Quakers to the network
                            was a natural outgrowth of the Society of Friends' concerns over slavery and of the failure
                            of a legal means for ending the practice. There was much disagreement among Quakers during
                            the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as they wrestled with how best to approach slavery.
                        </p>
                        <p>By the late eighteenth century there was denominational agreement that slavery was immoral
                            and members were not to participate. Individual Quakers in the New Garden area belonged to
                            the North Carolina Manumission Society established in 1814, including Levi Coffin and Vestal
                            Coffin. The group aimed for gradual emancipation and legal reforms.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="history-cell">
                        <p>As legal means seemed impossible, the Coffins pursued helping runaways escape to freedom
                            through extralegal means. In 1808 North Carolina Yearly Meeting, the statewide Quaker
                            organization, became a legal owner of enslaved persons to remove individual members from
                            ownership and protect the enslaved from being re-enslaved or relocated further South.</p>
                        <p>As new lands opened without slavery, many southern Quakers moved to Ohio and Indiana rather
                            than southwestern territories. North Carolina place names reappeared in Wayne County,
                            Indiana, notable for its Quaker and African American populations. A group remained in New
                            Garden with family ties to those who moved north.</p>

                        <p>In 1817 there was a Guilford County Supreme Court case where a black man named Benjamin
                            Benson, kidnapped in Delaware and sold into slavery, was freed. Though he won,
                            slaveholder

                            New Garden Quakers and neighbors partnered with local African Americans to support

                            In 1817 there was a lengthy legal case in the Guilford County Supreme Court in which a
                            black man named Benjamin Benson was kidnapped in Delaware and sold in Guilford County to
                            a slaveholder. The court decided in his favor eventually, but the backlash from
                            slaveholders sparked the idea of an organized method of helping enslaved people to
                            escape to freedom.
                            Quakers in the New Garden community and other anti-slavery neighbors partnered with
                            local African Americans, both enslaved and free, to provide a significant base of
                            support for fugitives escaping from slavery. Author Fergus Bordewich calls it our
